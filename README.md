## Contact Manager - Context
Contact management application created with React using its Context API
for state management. 

## Note
This application is a frontend app only. It has HTTP calls in place as if it were
full stack; however, they are to the JSONplaceholder API and are just used as placeholders
until a backend is for contacts to be persisted in a database.
